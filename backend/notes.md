mongoose 

Deep Explanation (in Simple English)
1. import mongoose from "mongoose"
Brings in Mongoose, a library that helps talk to MongoDB easily.

Like a smart assistant to control the database.

2. const connectDB = async () => { ... }
Creates a function called connectDB.

This function connects the app to the MongoDB database.

async is used because the database connection takes time, so it uses await.

3. mongoose.connection.on("connected", () => { ... })
Listens to Mongooseâ€™s built-in "connected" event.

When MongoDB is successfully connected, it runs the function inside:

js
Copy
Edit
console.log("DB connected");
4. await mongoose.connect(...)
Actually connects to MongoDB.

Uses process.env.MONGODB_URI from .env file.

Adds /e-commerce to choose (or create) a database named e-commerce.

5. export default connectDB
Makes the connectDB function available to be used in other files like server.js.

When server.js runs:

It calls connectCloudinary()

Cloudinary is now linked to your account

Now you can upload images in other files (like productController.js)

export default productRouter
